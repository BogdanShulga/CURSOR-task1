mkdir // created new folder for local repository "working-repository-2"
echo // created README.md
touch // created .gitignore with content from https://www.gitignore.io/api/linux

git push -u origin master // transmited local branch "master" to the remote branch "master"

git add // added text.txt to the stage area
git status // saw that I am ready for commit
git commit -m // made second commit on branch master
git push -u origin master // transmited local branch to the remote branch
git checkout -b // created new branch first and switched into it
nano // modified text.txt
git add // added text.txt to the stage area
git status // saw that I am ready for commit
